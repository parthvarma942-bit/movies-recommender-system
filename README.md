# movies-recommender-system
This project is a comprehensive guide to building a **Movie Recommender System**. It focuses on a **content-based filtering approach**, meaning it recommends movies based on their inherent characteristics (like genre, keywords, cast, and director) rather than on user behavior.

The project covers the entire development lifecycle:
* **Data Preparation:** This involves cleaning and preprocessing a movie dataset.
* **Feature Engineering:** Relevant information from genres, keywords, cast, and crew is extracted and transformed into "tags" for each movie.
* **Text Vectorization:** These textual tags are converted into numerical representations (vectors) using a Bag-of-Words model.
* **Similarity Calculation:** Cosine similarity is used to measure how alike different movies are based on their vectorized tags.
* **Recommendation Logic:** A function is created to suggest the top five most similar movies for any given movie.
* **Web Application Development:** A user-friendly interface is built using Streamlit.
* **Deployment:** The entire system is deployed on Heroku, making it a live, accessible web application.
